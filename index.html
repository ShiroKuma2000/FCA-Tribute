          <strong>Reward:</strong> The Galactic Federation is offering a reward of up to 1,000,000 Blemflarcks (Galactic Credits) for information leading to the capture or recovery of interdimensional criminal mastermind, Rick Sanchez of Earth (Dimension C-137).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Remarks:</strong> Sanchez is a known member of a resistance group consisting of other wanted interstellar terrorists, including Squanchy and Birdperson. He is a citizen of Earth (Dimension C-137), a primative planet dominated by primate-descended natives. He was last seen fleeing the scene of a galactic maximum security prison after he destroyed the facility and hacked into the Federation's level 9 systems, temporarily devaluing the exchange rate of the Blemflark - the standard currency of the Galactic Federation - to zero.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Caution:</strong> Rick Sanchez is wanted for a litany of offenses including, but not limited to: assault and battery, bioterrorism, burglary, unlawful possession and use of an interdimensional portal gun, illegal arms dealing, murder, kidnapping and false imprisonment of sentient life forms, smuggling, economic terrorism, vandalism, unauthorized manipulation of spacetime, and treason. He has consistently demonstrated a wanton disregard for sentient life, is prone to sporadic and violent outbursts, and has grown increasingly adept at evading apprehension efforts. An arrest warrant has been issued for Sanchez by the Galactic Federal Court System.
